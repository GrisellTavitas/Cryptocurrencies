# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Learning

Accountability Accounting have asked us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. After a complete analysis based on unsupervised machine learning, we proceed to:

- Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

As result we had 4 main groups that the data which fit determined paterns from each other:

We would have to go deeply on the analysis of each gropu, in order to see in which features were related one from another and be able to suggest an accurate investment option.
